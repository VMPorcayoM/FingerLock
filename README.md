# FingerLock

Lock with fingerprint opening from cell phone.

In this repository is the project called "FingerLock" which consists of an electric lock created with a development board and with Arduino code,
also making use of a mobile application developed on Android with which we can open the lock.

As the name of the project says, with our finger (the cell phone in which the app will be installed must have a fingerprint reader) using the fingerprint reader,
it will evaluate whether the lock will be opened or not.

The code to be mounted on your development board is in the "FingerLock.ino" file.

Also included is the project folder in Android of the mobile application with the name "FingerLock"
